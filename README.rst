##############################################
Call for Proposals for Community Alert Brokers
##############################################

LDM-723
=======

A major product of the nightly processing of LSST images is a world-public stream of alerts from transient, variable, and moving sources.
Science users may access these alerts through third-party community brokers, which will receive the LSST alerts, add scientific value, and redistribute them to the scientific community.
 
This document is a call for proposals for community brokers, as described in `Plans and Policies for LSST Alert Distribution (LDM-612) <https://ldm-612.lsst.io>`__.
